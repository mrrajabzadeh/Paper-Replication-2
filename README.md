# Mood Beta and Seasonalities in Stock Returns: Table 1 Replication

This project aims to replicate Table 1 from the study "Mood Beta and Seasonalities in Stock Returns" by David Hirshleifer, Danling Jiang, and Yuting Meng DiGiovanni, published in the Journal of Financial Economics in July 2020. The focus is on analyzing mood beta and seasonal patterns in stock returns using comprehensive data handling and econometric modeling.

## Overview

The code performs the following tasks:
- Establishes a connection to the WRDS database to fetch stock and financial data.
- Processes the data to identify and quantify mood-driven seasonal variations in stock returns.
- Employs Fama-MacBeth regression models to explore the predictability of returns based on these seasonal mood variations.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Retrieves stock price data and financial variables from the CRSP and Compustat databases via WRDS.
- **Data Processing**: Filters and processes stock data to focus on relevant securities and time frames, preparing it for analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conducts descriptive statistics and regression analyses to capture mood beta and seasonal effects on stock returns.

## Dependencies

To run this code, you'll need access to Python and the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `statsmodels`
- `linearmodels`
- `wrds`

A valid WRDS account is also necessary to access the required databases.

## File Structure

- **`mood_beta_seasonalities.py`**: The main Python script containing all code for data fetching, processing, and analysis.

## Usage

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure Python and all required libraries are installed. Configure your WRDS account credentials for database access.
2. **Execute the Script**: Run the `mood_beta_seasonalities.py` script to perform the analysis. The script will automatically handle data extraction, processing, and output generation.
3. **Review Results**: Analyze the outputs generated by the script, which will include both statistical summaries and regression results.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance the analysis or extend the scope of the replication are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
