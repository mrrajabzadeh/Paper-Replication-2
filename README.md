# Mood Beta and Seasonalities in Stock Returns: Table 1 Replication

This project aims to replicate Table 1 from the study "Mood Beta and Seasonalities in Stock Returns" by David Hirshleifer, Danling Jiang, and Yuting Meng DiGiovanni, published in the Journal of Financial Economics in July 2020. The focus is on analyzing mood beta and seasonal patterns in stock returns using comprehensive data handling and econometric modeling.

## Overview

The code performs the following tasks:
- Establishes a connection to the WRDS database to fetch stock and financial data.
- Processes the data to identify and quantify mood-driven seasonal variations in stock returns.
- Employs Fama-MacBeth regression models to explore the predictability of returns based on these seasonal mood variations.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Retrieves stock price data and financial variables from the CRSP and Compustat databases via WRDS.
- **Data Processing**: Filters and processes stock data to focus on relevant securities and time frames, preparing it for analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conducts descriptive statistics and regression analyses to capture mood beta and seasonal effects on stock returns.

## Dependencies

To run this code, you'll need access to Python and the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `statsmodels`
- `linearmodels`
- `wrds`

A valid WRDS account is also necessary to access the required databases.

## File Structure

- **`mood_beta_seasonalities.py`**: The main Python script containing all code for data fetching, processing, and analysis.

## Usage

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure Python and all required libraries are installed. Configure your WRDS account credentials for database access.
2. **Execute the Script**: Run the `mood_beta_seasonalities.py` script to perform the analysis. The script will automatically handle data extraction, processing, and output generation.
3. **Review Results**: Analyze the outputs generated by the script, which will include both statistical summaries and regression results.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance the analysis or extend the scope of the replication are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

# Mood Beta and Seasonalities in Stock Returns: Table 2 Replication

This repository contains the Python code for replicating Table 2 of the paper "Mood Beta and Seasonalities in Stock Returns" by David Hirshleifer, Danling Jiang, and Yuting Meng DiGiovanni. The study, published in the Journal of Financial Economics in July 2020, explores the impact of mood beta and seasonal patterns on stock returns.

## Project Description

The replication focuses on the application of Fama-MacBeth regression analysis to investigate the predictability of returns based on mood-driven seasonal variations. The dataset includes monthly-level stock return data from the CRSP database and Fama-French factors.

## Key Features

- **Data Extraction**: Retrieves detailed monthly stock return data and associated characteristics from the CRSP database using WRDS.
- **Data Preparation**: Filters and processes the dataset to focus on common stocks traded on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conducts regressions to analyze the mood congruence and reversal effects on stock returns.

## Requirements

To run this code, ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- statsmodels
- wrds
- linearmodels

## Usage

1. **Configuration**: Set up your environment with the necessary Python libraries and ensure access to the WRDS database.
2. **Execution**: Run the script to fetch data, perform data processing, and execute the regression analyses.
3. **Output**: Review the output from the Fama-MacBeth regressions to analyze the mood beta and seasonal effects.

## File Descriptions

- **`mood_beta_seasonality_table2.py`**: Contains all the code necessary for the replication of Table 2 from the aforementioned study.
